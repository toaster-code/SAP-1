Malvino's Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture implemented using Digital Works.

## Usage

1) Digital Works is the software that I have used to simulate the SAP-1. To get it, Visit https://www.mecanique.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/category&path=89 to download the software to open the `dwm` file. Download the zip file and run the executable (I've tested using windows 10 and it works. Linux users may find sucess with wine).

Note: In 2013 Digital Works was released **free for anyone to use**. The autor released v3.0.5.0 which has all licensing restrictions removed.

3) Once installed, open Digital Works and load the SAP-1 project [file](https://github.com/toaster-code/SAP-1/raw/main/Sap%20completo%20FINAL.dwm).

## About my SAP-1 Project:

I've created this circuit during 2002 summer vacations. I used Digital Works to replicate the SAP-1 architecture. I was hopping for using it in a TCC project in digital circuits. Unfortunately, the project did not went as I expected.
Despite that, I decided to continue working to finish the simulations, just for fun ;)

Recently I found the source file in an old CD backup and I decided to share it, in case anyone get interested. So enjoy!
