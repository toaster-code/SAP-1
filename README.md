# SAP-1

Malvino's Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer architecture implemented using Digital Works.

I created this circuit during the summer vacations of 2002 using Digital Works to propose as my TCC project in digital circuits. Unfortunately, the project did not go as expected. Despite that, I decided to continue and finish the simulations for fun ;)

I've located my source files in an old CD backup and decided to share them in case anyone is interested.

Enjoy!

Digital Works 3.0.5.0 was released in 2013 with all the licensing restrictions removed and is now **free for anyone to use**.

Download the zip file and run it. I've tested using windows 10 and it works. Linux users may find sucess using wine.
