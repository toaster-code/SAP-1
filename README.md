## Usage

Visit https://www.mecanique.co.uk/shop/index.php?route=product/category&path=89 to download Digital Works.

Digital Works 3.0.5.0 was released in 2013 with all the licensing restrictions removed and is now **free for anyone to use**.

Download the zip file and run the executable. I've tested using windows 10 and it works (Linux users may find sucess using wine).

Once installed, open Digital Works and load the SAP-1 project [file](https://github.com/toaster-code/SAP-1/raw/main/Sap%20completo%20FINAL.dwm).

## About my SAP-1 Project:

I've created this circuit during the summer vacations of 2002 using Digital Works for a TCC project in digital circuits. Unfortunately, the project did not go as expected. Despite that, I decided to continue working on it to finish the simulations, just for fun ;)

I've located my source files in an old CD backup and decided to share, in case anyone get interested. Enjoy!

Note: Descriptions of the circuits are all in portuguese.
For any questions or clarifications, feel free to send me a hello!
